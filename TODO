See if audio can come as data urls. And if so, can we just embed the soundtrack as strings?

Cloud effects
Tiling map engine
Space screen!!!!!!!!


Audio:
 -find an empty audio channel and play on it (or stop a previous channel and repurpose it?)
 -soundtrack channel
  (do screens come with soundtracks?)

Upgrade tree / simulation logic




javascripts:
 -use addEventListener not setting onclick
 -use appendChild() not insertBefore
 use (function() { ... })(); to create a private namespace
 -use localStorage to store datas
