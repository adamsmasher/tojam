Bug Logan and Annamaria for Graphics

See if audio can come as data urls. And if so, can we just embed the soundtrack as strings?

Cloud effects
Tiling map engine
Space screen!!!!!!!!

preloader

Audio:
 -find an empty audio channel and play on it (or stop a previous channel and repurpose it?)
 -soundtrack channel
  (do screens come with soundtracks?)

Upgrade tree / simulation logic




javascripts:
 -use addEventListener not setting onclick
 -use appendChild() not insertBefore
 use (function() { ... })(); to create a private namespace
 -use localStorage to store datas
